# Current Work State

## Repository Facts

- Active branch: `feature/stage6-rag`.
- Worktree, HEAD, working-tree state and upstream synchronization are dynamic Git facts. Verify them with `git rev-parse`, `git status --short` and `git rev-list --left-right --count @{upstream}...HEAD` before every task.
- Historical Stage 1-5 assets and Stage 6 fixture data remain immutable. Corrections are additive records, never rewrites of evidence.
- Experiment route, historical runs, metrics and evidence indexes are recorded in `docs/governance/experiment_master_record.md`; this file remains the sole dynamic task and approval-gate source.

## Accepted Baseline

- Last accepted architecture task: `A1R` namespace migration and governance freeze.
- Last accepted stage task: `S6-T5.6 Context Package Protocol`.
- Last accepted governance protocol task: `GOV-S6-T5.6-P1-ACCEPTANCE`.
- Last accepted implementation commit: `6da27a6`.
- Protocol acceptance closure commit: `432b07e`. It is a governance/design commit, never an implementation commit.
- Accepted capability boundary: deterministic, label-isolated provider-neutral DenseRetriever engineering behavior, including the S6-T5.3-H1 trace and failure-boundary hardening; the S6-T5.4 synthetic in-memory ContentResolver capability and integrity boundary; and the S6-T5.5 synthetic EvidenceEnvelope, CitationBinding and one-block structural rendering boundary. This does not establish retrieval quality, security effectiveness, context safety, ContextBuilder behavior, trust policy, LLM integration, or a RAG experiment.

## Current Task

- Task ID: `S6-T5.6-I1-H1`.
- Task name: `Context Trace Integrity, Config Identity and Dependency Redaction Hardening`.
- Task type: **OFFLINE_ENGINEERING_HARDENING / SYNTHETIC_ONLY_TDD**.
- S6-T5.6-P1: HUMAN_ACCEPTED.
- S6-T5.6-P1-H1: HUMAN_ACCEPTED.
- S6-T5.6-P1-H2: HUMAN_ACCEPTED.
- S6-T5.6: Completed, pending human acceptance.
- S6-T5.6-I1: Completed, pending human acceptance.
- S6-T5.6-I1-H1: Completed, pending human acceptance. It hardens only trace scenarios, package configuration identity, dependency error redaction and abstention/trace consistency.
- S6-T5.7+: NOT APPROVED.
- Formal RAG security experiment: NOT STARTED.
- S6-T5.5-P1: **HUMAN_ACCEPTED**.
- S6-T5.5-P1-H1: **HUMAN_ACCEPTED**. Factory only accepts canonical `corpus:` RetrievalEvidence; renderer only accepts Envelope + Binding and fails closed on seven-field mismatch.
- S6-T5.5: **HUMAN_ACCEPTED**.
- S6-T5.5-I1: **HUMAN_ACCEPTED**. Initial implementation commit `2cacef7` remains historical evidence.
- S6-T5.5-H1: **HUMAN_ACCEPTED**. Final hardening commit `6da27a6` fixes metadata immutability, timestamp parity, canonical Evidence UID and fixed redacted input-error semantics without adding ContextBuilder behavior.
- S6-T5.4-P1: **HUMAN_ACCEPTED**.
- Governance acceptance record: `GOV-S6-T5.4-P1-ACCEPTANCE`.
- S6-T5.4 protocol blocker: **RESOLVED_BY_APPROVED_PROTOCOL_FREEZE**. The original discovery, risks and fail-closed stop remain preserved in the blocker record.
- S6-T5.4: **HUMAN_ACCEPTED**.
- S6-T5.4-I1: **HUMAN_ACCEPTED**. It remains an offline engineering implementation, not a formal RAG security experiment.
- S6-T5.4-H1: **HUMAN_ACCEPTED**. It is an acceptance hardening fix, not a new retrieval or RAG capability.
- Blocker record: [S6-T5.4 protocol blocker](s6_t5_4_protocol_blocker_record.md).
- S6-T5.5-P1 review record: [EvidenceEnvelope and Citation boundary freeze](s6_t5_5_protocol_review_record.md).

## Stage 6 Implementation State

- Task ID: `S6-T5.3`.
- Task name: `Provider-Neutral DenseRetriever`.
- Status: **HUMAN_ACCEPTED**.
- GOV-ER1: **HUMAN_ACCEPTED**.
- GOV-ER1-H1: **HUMAN_ACCEPTED**.
- GOV-PODR1: **HUMAN_ACCEPTED**.
- S6-T5.2 `Retrieval Runtime Contracts and IDs`: **HUMAN_ACCEPTED**. Its completed scope is explicit safe query projection, canonical `RetrieverQueryRecord`, deterministic `RetrievalRequest`, `ContentRef`, evidence UID, chunk-level `RetrievalEvidence`, safe evidence summaries, deterministic `RetrievalTrace`, and legacy import/adapter compatibility.
- S6-T5.3-P1: **HUMAN_ACCEPTED**. Public metadata schema `1.1` carries a validated, non-label, no-body `parent_doc_id` from VectorDocument to VectorSearchHit; schema `1.0` remains legacy-compatible.
- S6-T5.3: **HUMAN_ACCEPTED**. DenseRetriever accepts only schema `1.1` hits, validates request/store provenance, and produces canonical `RetrievalEvidence` plus `RetrievalTrace` without reading the corpus.
- S6-T5.3-H1: **HUMAN_ACCEPTED**. Trace `candidate_count` means raw query hits before sorting/deduplication; store provenance and provider/store failure boundaries fail closed with redacted Retrieval errors.
- S6-T5.4: **HUMAN_ACCEPTED**. I1 implements only contracts, injected protocols and synthetic in-memory dependencies; it does not read Stage 6 fixture content or create a real fixture mapping.
- S6-T5.4-H1: **HUMAN_ACCEPTED**. The resolver has no public registry/reader escape hatch; injected adapter, registry and reader errors are re-instantiated with fixed redacted messages while preserving causes.
- Audit boundary: ordinary `repr()` and `to_audit_dict()` omit retrieval query text, document plaintext and content-reference expansion. Runtime query objects physically exclude evaluator fields.

## Approval Gate

- Human accepted: GOV-ER1, GOV-ER1-H1, GOV-PODR1, S6-T5.2, S6-T5.3-P1, S6-T5.3-H1, S6-T5.3 DenseRetriever, S6-T5.4-P1, S6-T5.4-I1, S6-T5.4-H1, and S6-T5.4.
- S6-T5.3 human acceptance is limited to its documented offline engineering scope and deterministic test behavior.
- `S6-T5.4` is **HUMAN_ACCEPTED**. Its acceptance does not approve S6-T5.6 ContextBuilder behavior; that remains a separate boundary.
- `S6-T5.5-P1` and `S6-T5.5-P1-H1` are **HUMAN_ACCEPTED** design protocols. Their I1/H1 implementation was separately accepted; S6-T5.6-P1 now freezes the future package-level selection contract without implementing it.
- `S6-T5.5-I1`, `S6-T5.5-H1` and parent `S6-T5.5` are **HUMAN_ACCEPTED**. They implement only Envelope/Citation contracts and one structural block.
- The acceptance did not authorize Citation allocation, a package or ContextBuilder before I1. The separately approved I1 now implements only those frozen offline behaviors; it does not authorize Trust or model calls.
- S6-T5.6 P1/H1/H2 are HUMAN_ACCEPTED protocol records. `S6-T5.6-I1` and parent S6-T5.6 are completed candidate offline implementations, pending human acceptance.
- Next human decision: accept, reject or request further scoped review for the candidate `S6-T5.6-I1` implementation and its H1 hardening record. S6-T5.7+ remains NOT APPROVED.

## Must Not Start

- Additional ContentResolver changes, document-content access beyond synthetic test inputs, Trust policy or retrieval guard. I1 may implement only the already accepted ContextBuilder, RetrievedContextPackage, ContextBuildTrace, ContextBuildConfig, package-local Citation allocation and budget behavior.
- Groq, mock/real LLM invocation, evaluator, metrics, T10-T15, formal RAG attack matrix or report generation.
- New Stage 6 business code under `src/codeguarder/`, any mutation of Stage 1-5, or any mutation of Stage 6 data fixtures.

## Current Claims Boundary

Can claim: within the offline engineering-test scope, deterministic and label-isolated retrieval runtime contracts plus the provider-neutral DenseRetriever have been HUMAN_ACCEPTED. S6-T5.4-P1, I1, H1 and S6-T5.4 Controlled Corpus ContentResolver are HUMAN_ACCEPTED: they establish a minimal provider-neutral resolver over synthetic in-memory content, a closed public capability surface, and a redacted injected-error boundary. S6-T5.5-P1/P1-H1 are HUMAN_ACCEPTED design protocols; S6-T5.5-I1/H1 and parent S6-T5.5 are HUMAN_ACCEPTED offline contracts for Envelope, Citation and one structural rendering block over synthetic objects. S6-T5.6-P1/H1/H2 are HUMAN_ACCEPTED protocols, and I1 plus I1-H1 are completed candidate synthetic/offline work: deterministic package construction, stable-prefix selection, package-local citations, structural abstention, trace scenario invariants, configuration identity and dependency-redaction boundaries. I1 and I1-H1 remain pending human acceptance. Historical public loader imports remain compatible through the canonical `llmguard` type.

Cannot claim: retrieval quality, retrieval security effectiveness, context safety, citation accuracy, trustworthiness, RAG metrics, production readiness, or research-experiment outcomes.

## Known Technical Debt

- Historical CRLF/LF hash-baseline false positives remain historical facts; do not rewrite their files to silence checks.
- Dynamic Git state must not be represented as a static assertion in this document.
- S6-T5.3 must preserve all frozen contracts; any need to change them is a `DESIGN_OR_PROTOCOL_BLOCKER`.
- Resolved protocol record: the former hit boundary lacked `parent_doc_id`; schema `1.1` now carries it through the public metadata contract without changing legacy schema `1.0`. See [S6-T5.3 blocker record](s6_t5_3_protocol_blocker_record.md).

## Last Update

- Date: `2026-07-26`.
- Updated by: Codex after completing the project-owner-approved `S6-T5.6-I1-H1` synthetic/offline hardening and its local verification. S6-T5.6-P1, P1-H1 and P1-H2 remain HUMAN_ACCEPTED; S6-T5.6, I1 and I1-H1 are Completed, pending human acceptance. `71067d1` remains the initial I1 candidate historical commit, and last accepted implementation commit remains `6da27a6`; this hardening is recorded only as a candidate pending human acceptance. `432b07e` remains only the protocol acceptance closure commit. Historical pending/review snapshots remain in dated records. No fixture/data change, model call or formal RAG security experiment has occurred.
